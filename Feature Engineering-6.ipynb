    "# Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores. How to Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "Ans:To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you would need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the mean of both variables.\n",
    "Calculate the standard deviation of both variables.\n",
    "For each student, calculate the deviation of their study time and exam score from the mean.\n",
    "Multiply the deviations for each student and sum them.\n",
    "Divide the sum by the product of the standard deviations.\n",
    "The resulting value will be the Pearson correlation coefficient, which can range from -1 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive correlation coefficient indicates that there is a positive linear relationship between the two variables. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, so does the final exam score.\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative correlation coefficient indicates that there is a negative linear relationship between the two variables. This means that as the amount of time spent studying decreases, the final exam score increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The closer the correlation coefficient is to -1 or 1, the stronger the linear relationship is between the two variables. A value of 0.5 or greater is generally considered a moderate to strong correlation. A value of less than 0.5 is considered a weak correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated, it does not mean that one causes the other. Other factors may be involved that affect both variables."
